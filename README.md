### Hi there 👋

I am a Colombian biologist with a Master of Science from the Instituto de Ecología A.C. (INECOL) in Mexico. I am currently a Ph.D. student at INECOL. My work has focused on the use of statistical models to estimate and interpret the spatial co-occurrence of mammals, mainly using camera trap🐺🐱🐇 data. I am enthusiastic about learning and using statistics 💻 to solve problems and questions about mammalian ecology (although in general, it can be about any critter). I am passionate about teaching and have participated in several workshops as a teacher and coordinator. In the workshops, I have covered topics ranging from data organization, occupancy modeling, diversity estimation, data visualization, and general statistics. Some of what I teach in the courses can be seen in the blog section. Of course, I try to do everything in R. I forgot to mention that I am obsessed with R and use it to write, teach, analyze, and visualize data on everything I can think of. I'm an ecologist and not a programmer, so it's worth clarifying that being obsessed with R doesn't make me good at R 🤫🤪
