### Hi there 👋

I am a Colombian biologist (National University of Colombia) with a Master's and Doctorate in Science from the Institute of Ecology (INECOL) in Mexico. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture at Stephen F. Austin State University. My work has focused on the use of statistical models to estimate and interpret the spatial co-occurrence of mammals, mainly using camera trap🐺🐱🐇 data. I am enthusiastic about learning and using statistics 💻 to solve problems and questions about mammalian ecology (although in general, it can be about any critter). I am passionate about teaching and have participated in several workshops as a teacher and coordinator. In the workshops, I have covered topics ranging from data organization, occupancy modeling, diversity estimation, data visualization, and general statistics. Some of what I teach in the courses can be seen in the blog section. Of course, I try to do everything in R. I forgot to mention that I am obsessed with R and use it to write, teach, analyze, and visualize data on everything I can think of. I'm an ecologist and not a programmer, so it's worth clarifying that being obsessed with R doesn't make me good at R 🤫🤪
